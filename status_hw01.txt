My first issue was adding my non-root account to the sudoers list.
I then struggled to connect the domain name with the IP when
searching for the web page. I also struggled with understanding 
the uses of sites-available vs sites-enabled (both for how to 
implement subdomain and main index, as well as what these 
directories did).

I was able to resolve everything by google search,
youtube, and piazza posts.
